.SH DESCRIPTION
A bitfield is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfsetall()\fR function takes a pointer to bitfield \fIinstance\fR, and sets all its bits (i.e. fills the bitfield with units).
.sp
The \fBbfclearall()\fR function takes a pointer to bitfield \fIinstance\fR, and clears all its bits (i.e. fills the bitfield with zeroes).
