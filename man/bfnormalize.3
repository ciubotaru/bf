.SH NAME
bfcat \- find the smallest value of a bitfield ring.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "#include <bitfield.h>
.sp
.BI "struct bitfield *bfnormalize(const struct bitfield *"input ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A bitfield is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfnormalize()\fR function takes a pointer to a bitfield, \fIinput\fR, and creates a new bitfield, which represents the original array of bits loop-shifted in such a way as to produce the smallest binary number. The function returns a pointer to the new bitfield.
