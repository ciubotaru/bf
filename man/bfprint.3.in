bfprint_lsb, bfprint_msb \- write the contents of a bitfield to stdout as zeroes and ones.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
A bitfield is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfprint_lsb()\fR function takes a poiinter to bitfield \fIinstance\fR, and writes its bits to \fIstdout\fR as zeroes and ones, from left to right, least significant bit first.
.sp
The \fBbfprint_msb()\fR function takes a poiinter to bitfield \fIinstance\fR, and writes its bits to \fIstdout\fR as zeroes and ones, from left to right, most significant bit first.
