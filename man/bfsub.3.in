.SH DESCRIPTION
A bit array is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfsub()\fR function takes a pointer to bitfield \fIinput\fR, the number of the \fIstart\fR bit and \fIend\fR bit, and creates a new bitfield that contains bits between \fIstart\fR (included) bit and \fIend\fR(not included) bit from the \fIinput\fR bitfield. The function returns a pointer to the new bitfield.
