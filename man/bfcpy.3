.SH DESCRIPTION
A bitfield is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfcpy()\fR function takes pointers to bitfields \fIsrc\fR and \fIdest\fR, and copies the bits from \fIsrc\fR to \fIdest\fR bit. The function returns 0 on success and 1 otherwise.
