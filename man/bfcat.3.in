.SH DESCRIPTION
A bit array is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfcat()\fR function takes one or more arguments, all of them pointers to bitfields, and creates a new bitfield that contains all bits from all bitfields, consequtively. The function returns a pointer to the new bitfield or NULL on failure.
