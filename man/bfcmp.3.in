.SH NAME
bfcmp \- compare two bit arrays.

.SH DESCRIPTION
A bit array is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfcmp()\fR function takes pointers to two bitfields, \fIinput1\fR and \fIinput2\fR, and a pointer to a string \fIerrmsg\fR, and compares them bit-to-bit. The function returns 0 if the two bitfields are identical, 1 if they differ or 2 if they have different size. In case the bitfields are different or have different size, the function also returns an error message \fIerrmsg\fR.
