.SH NAME
bfhamming \- counts the Humming distance between two bitfields.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
A bitfield is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfhamming()\fR function is an implementation of Hamming distance between two bitfields. It takes pointers to bitfields \fIinput1\fR and \fIinput2\fR, and returns the number of bits that are different between the two bitfields.
