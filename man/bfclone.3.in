.SH NAME
bfclone \- create a copy of an existing bitfield.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B "#include <bitfield.h>
.sp
.BI "struct bitfield *bfclone(struct bitfield *"input ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A bitfield is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfclone()\fR function initializes a bitfield of the same \fIsize\fR as \fIinput\fR, copies the content of \fIinput\fR into the new bitfield and returns a pointer to it.
.SH EXAMPLES
The following code
.sp
    struct bitfield * my_new_bitfield = bfclone(my_old_bitfield);
.sp
will creates a bitfield called \fImy_new_bitfield\fR, whose size and contents are identical to \fImy_old_bitfield\fR.
.sp
