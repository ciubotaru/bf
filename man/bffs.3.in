.SH NAME
bffs, bffz \- find the first set or clear bit in a bit array.

.sp
.BI "unsigned int bffs(const struct bitfield *"instance ");
.BI "unsigned int bffz(const struct bitfield *"instance ");

.SH DESCRIPTION
A bit array is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbffs()\fR function searches for the first set bit in a bit array. It takes a pointer to bitfield \fIinstance\fR and returns the index of the first set bit, starting from one. If there are no set bits, it returns 0.
.sp
The \fBbffz()\fR function searches for the first clear bit in a bit array. It takes a pointer to bitfield \fIinstance\fR and returns the index of the first clear bit, starting from one. If there are no clear bits, it returns 0.
