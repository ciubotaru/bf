.SH NAME
bfrev, bifrev_ip \- reverse the order of bits in a bit array.
.SH SYNOPSIS

.SH DESCRIPTION
A bit array is represented by a "struct bitfield". It has two elements: an array of unsigned long integers \fIfield\fR and an unsigned integer \fIsize\fR.
.sp
The \fBbfrev()\fR function takes a pointer to bitfield \fIinput\fR and reverses the order of bits in it. The function returns a pointer to the new, reversed bitfield, or NULL on failure.
.sp
The \fBbfrev_ip()\fR function takes a pointer to bitfield \fIinstance\fR and reverses the order of bits in it. The changes are made "in place", in the original bitfield.
